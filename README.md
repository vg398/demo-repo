# Victor Gonzalez (vg398) Bio

Hello! I was born out in the Bay Area in California and my family lived in Red Wood City, CA. They shipped me out to Denver, CO to live my grandmother (my mom's mother, my mom is from Denver) when I was about 1 years old, as life wasn't easy for my
family at that time. I grew up in Denver and consider that my hometown. I was always a pretty good student when I was young but ran into a number of health issues in my mid-teens and never graduated high school. I floated around working and getting my
GED in my early 20s, but never really figured out what I should do in life. In my later 20s, I got inspired to persue ECE from a guy who owned a video game store in Denver, as well as one my favorite fighters having a background in EE (Takeya Mizugaki).
I wasn't sure how to approach it, as none of my family had attended college, but I had a plan to take classes at my nearby community college (Araphaoe Community College) and then transfer to Colorado School of Mines ones I earned all the transferrable
credit hours. I was in the Phi Theta Kappa honors society and regional director went to school with me at ACC. She told me about Missisippi State and I decided to attend it when I heard about the various programs I could get involved in (EcoCar, research,
etc., things that School of Mines did not really have since it's more geoscience focused), as well as being less expensive for tuition and cost of living. I've been out here since February of 2021 and very much looking forward to finishing this Spring. I 
just have to be sure to stay as focused and on-top of eveyrthing as possible.
